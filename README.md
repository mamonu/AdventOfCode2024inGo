Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in Go!


## About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in Go. Each day's solution is contained within its own directory, named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number.

## Structure
